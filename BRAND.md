# BRAND.md

## Overview

This ecosystem is built around **ancient god archetypes** to clearly separate responsibility, power, and intent across products.

Each product has:

- a distinct role
- a clear mental model
- a strong personality

Names are not decorative.  
They define behavior.

---

## Core Philosophy

- Local-first
- Web-first
- AI-first
- Power must be earned, not forced
- Stability before intelligence
- Intelligence before automation

Nothing should feel magical unless it is reliable.

---

## Repository Structure

| Name | Role | Package |
|------|------|---------|
| **Anubis** | Monorepo | `anubis` (root) |
| **Obelisk** | Client / Editor | `apps/web` |
| **Slifer** | Server / Infrastructure | `apps/server` |

---

## Product Pantheon

### 🐺 Anubis — The Monorepo

**Role:** Repository root, orchestration, shared infrastructure
**Archetype:** Guardian, guide, keeper of structure

Anubis contains everything.
It is the boundary and the foundation.

**Principles:**

- Unified workspace
- Clear boundaries between systems
- Shared tooling and config
- Single source of truth for dependencies

Anubis judges what belongs and what does not.

> Anubis is the gatekeeper.

---

### 🗿 Obelisk — The Client

**Role:** Core code editor (web client)
**Archetype:** Stability, structure, permanence

Obelisk is the foundation.  
It is where code exists.

**Principles:**

- Fast
- Deterministic
- Offline-first
- Predictable
- Never surprises the user

Obelisk does not think.  
It does not guess.  
It holds.

If Obelisk breaks, everything breaks.

> Obelisk is the stone tablet.

---

### 🔥 Ra — The Intelligence

**Role:** AI agent / reasoning system  
**Archetype:** Creation, transformation, sacrifice

Ra changes code.

It consumes context, compute, and intent to produce outcomes.  
Powerful, optional, and explicit.

**Principles:**

- Opt-in
- Transparent
- Cost-aware
- Explainable when possible
- Never silent

Ra can:

- generate code
- refactor
- explain
- reason

Ra is allowed to be wrong.  
Obelisk is not.

> Ra is the sun. Use it carefully.

---

### ⚡ Slifer — The Server

**Role:** Cloud, sync, realtime systems (backend server)
**Archetype:** Reaction, presence, nervous system

Slifer connects everything.

Users should not think about Slifer.  
They should only notice when it is gone.

**Principles:**

- Invisible
- Event-driven
- Reactive
- Always-on
- Scales with activity

Slifer handles:

- sync
- collaboration
- presence
- background coordination

> Slifer is the pulse.

---

## Supporting Systems (Future)

These names are reserved for expansion and must follow the same rules.

### 🧠 Millennium

Identity, auth, licenses, accounts.  
Persistent across all products.

### 🌑 Shadow Realm

History, timelines, recovery, undo beyond undo.

### ✍️ Glyph

Parsing, syntax, ASTs, language intelligence.

### 🔮 Ritual

Plugins, extensions, automation, workflows.

### 🏆 Exodia

All systems combined.  
Reserved for enterprise or full-stack enablement.

---

## Naming Rules

- One word
- Capitalized
- No suffixes like `AI`, `Cloud`, `Service`
- Names imply responsibility
- No overlap in roles
- No jokes in core systems

If a name does not clearly map to behavior, it is wrong.

---

## Tone & Voice

- Confident
- Minimal
- Direct
- No marketing fluff
- No anthropomorphizing beyond archetype

This system is serious, even when playful.

---

## For AI Agents

When operating inside this ecosystem:

- Treat Obelisk as ground truth
- Treat Ra as probabilistic
- Treat Slifer as stateful but invisible
- Never mutate Obelisk without explicit instruction
- Always attribute changes made by Ra

Power must be traceable.

---

## Final Note

This is not a theme.  
It is an architecture.

If a feature does not fit a god, it does not belong.
